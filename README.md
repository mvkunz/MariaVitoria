# Who's Maria Vit√≥ria?

I am currently pursuing a Higher National Diploma in Systems Analysis at Est√°cio, with an expected graduation date of June 2024. I am also enrolled in a Software Engineering course at Trybe, an online school teaching me the key technologies and skills in demand in the industry. At Trybe, I am learning about backend development, databases, unit testing, and other tools that augment my knowledge in frontend development. I am proactive, communicative, enjoy challenges, and am keen on learning new things. My goal is to become a skilled and up-to-date full-stack developer.
